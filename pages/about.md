Hi, my name is Sydney! I currently work as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.realtor.com/">Realtor.com</a>. In a past life (under my maiden name, Sydney Maples) I worked as a backend platform engineer at <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda, Inc.</a>. Before that, I was a student at Stanford University, where I served as the president of the <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu/about/history-program/barwise-award-distinguished-contributions-symbolic-systems">Symbolic Systems Society</a> and graduated with my degree in <a href="http://www.symsyssociety.org/whatissymsys">Symbolic Systems</a> in 2018. I was also the photography director of <a href="https://issuu.com/mint_magazine">Mint Magazine</a> from its inception in 2013 until my graduation, as well as the technical team leader of the CS + Mental Health initiative, where several neat projects were conceptualized and created, including <a href="https://woebothealth.com/">Woebot</a>!

I am generally interested in anything relating to the systems that undercurrent our daily lives, both from a technical and a sociological standpoint. I also love the feeling of diving into something completely new and being able to relate it back to topics I'm already familiar with, and the sheer breadth of topics and concepts to learn is part of why both machine learning and software engineering appeal to me. Outside of work, you can find me <a href="{{site.url}}/blog">writing</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40582536-sydney-trinidad">reading a book</a>, doting on my two disgustingly adorable maltipoos, listening to the same classic rock bands over and over, or miserably failing at skiing.
