Hi, my name is Sydney! I currently work as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://www.realtor.com/">Realtor.com</a>. In a past life (under my maiden name, Sydney Maples) I worked as a backend platform engineer at <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda, Inc.</a>. Before that, I was a student at Stanford University, where I served as the president of the <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu/about/history-program/barwise-award-distinguished-contributions-symbolic-systems">Symbolic Systems Society</a> and graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in <a href="http://www.symsyssociety.org/whatissymsys">Symbolic Systems</a> in 2018. I was also the technical team leader of the CS + Mental Health initiative, where we foresaw the creation of several neat projects (including <a href="https://woebothealth.com/">Woebot</a>!), as well as the photography director of <a href="https://issuu.com/mint_magazine">Mint Magazine</a> from its inception until my graduation.

Wherever possible, I try to write about new things I'm learning on my <a href="{{site.url}}/">blog</a> or post useful technical <a href="{{site.url}}/notes">notes</a> and snippets. Outside of work, you can find me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40582536-sydney-trinidad">reading a book</a>, doting on my two adorable maltipoos, listening to the same classic rock bands over and over, or failing miserably at skiing.

I am always happy to receive email, especially from aspiring students or engineers. <a href="mailto:sydneyctrinidad@gmail.com">Don't hesitate to reach out.</a>
